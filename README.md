# Obsidoro

Obsidoro is a [Pomodoro Timer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) for Obsidian. 

--------

To run the timer 

`py obsidoro.py <path_to_vault>`

On first run it will create a Obsidoro.md, this is where the timer will live. 

------

To use just open up Obsidoro note in your vault and set it to display mode. Start the timer by unchecking the "Start/Pause" checkbox. 

It will then run until you pause it with the same box or you kill the python program. 

-----

Feel free to suggest improvements or fork it.

Sorry in advanced for the poor python, I'm more a C person
